                    "Since 2006 I've owned quite a number of Indiana Jones Jackets from other manufacturers. 
                    All the while I've been searching for the perfect Raiders of the Lost Ark jacket with all 
                    it's perculiar features, each of which is necessary in order to get the 'look'. Id begun to 
                    give up hope! Finally, Steele and Jones have produced an affordable jacket that fits the bill 
                    perfectly. The collar hangs off the back of the neck just as we see in the film, the leather 
                    is textured in the right places but not like a piece of snake skin and the hide is light in 
                    weight so that it drapes and flows like a fabric - just as we see in Raiders 
                    (and even more so when watching the Bluray!). Due to the nature of the leather, 
                    which replicates what's seen on screen, this is not the most robust jacket I've owned 
                    but it is far and away the most accurate in appearance. Great work guys from a satisfied customer."

                    "I'm speechless. So i will proceed to a breakdown of pros and cons of this fedora: PROS:
                    -first sensation right out of the box: touch. fine felt and dense. lots of quality. it feels to resist everything you throw at it. feels like mistreat instead of take care of it.
                    -second impression: bashing and appearance. seems straight out of the movie. from ribbon and bow to the crown and brim are all accurately reproduced. even have to pull down the brim when you put it on, Ford's style.
                    -perfect-sizing and proportions right for my melon.
                    CONS:
                    -haven't ordered it before. now i'd have an Explorador and a Viajero."

                    'illness' to buy everything come out, but now with the Explorador it's over, i don't buy more
